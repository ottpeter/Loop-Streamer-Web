## Instance daemon

This is a Flask application, that is handling the connection between Loop-Streamer-Web, and the streamer instance.
It should be easy to configure it for Loop-Streamer 1 and Loop-Streamer-2.0 as well.
First thing that the app will do is send "hi" to the server, for which the Loop-Streamer-Web server will reply.
